## TL;DR

Recast is a fundamentally different approach to building React components to maximise reusability.

## What is Recast?

Recast is not just a collection of utilities; it is an approach/pattern to building **truly** reusable component primitives by abstracting the theme layer from the internal workings of a component.

The specific values that an Recast "primitive" can receive are not specified within the component, instead these are defined by wrapping the component with a styles definition that will form the theme API.

## Who is Recast for?

Recast is for any individual/team who wants to build a truly reusable component
library that can be used across projects without duplicating code purely for the
purposes of theming.
