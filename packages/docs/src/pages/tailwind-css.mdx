# Recast Tailwind CSS Integration

Recast offers seamless integration with Tailwind CSS through our dedicated
plugin, enhancing your development experience and unlocking powerful styling
capabilities.

## Installation

First, install the Recast Tailwind plugin:

```bash
npm install @rpxl/recast-tailwind-plugin
```

## Setup

If you're using Tailwind CSS, add the Recast plugin to your
`tailwind.config.js`:

```js
module.exports = {
  // ...other config
  plugins: [require("@rpxl/recast-tailwind-plugin")],
};
```

This step is necessary if you're using Tailwind CSS and want to leverage the
Recast Tailwind plugin's features.

### What the Tailwind CSS Integration Provides:

1. **Automatic Safelist Generation**: The plugin automatically generates a
   safelist for your Recast components based on the breakpoints specified in
   your component definitions. This ensures that all Tailwind classes used in
   your Recast components are included in your production build, even if they
   aren't explicitly used in your templates.

2. **Responsive Styling**: The plugin enables responsive styling for Recast
   components using Tailwind's responsive syntax. Responsive component features
   are opt-in on a per-component basis. For example:

```jsx
const Button = recast(ButtonPrimitive, {
  variants: {
    size: {
      sm: "px-2 py-1 text-sm",
      md: "px-4 py-2 text-base",
      lg: "px-6 py-3 text-lg",
    },
  },
  // Only allow these breakpoints to be
  // used within the button component
  breakpoints: ["sm", "md", "lg"],
});

<Button size={{ default: "sm", md: "md", lg: "lg" }}>Responsive Button</Button>;
```

Will generate the following classes:

```html
<button
  class="px-2 py-1 text-sm md:px-4 md:py-2 md:text-base lg:px-6 lg:py-3 lg:text-lg"
>
  Responsive Button
</button>
```

<Callout type="info">
  Use responsive styles carefully. Specified breakpoints will automatically
  generate and add the corresponding classes to Tailwind, whether they're used
  or not. This is due to how Tailwind CSS statically analyzes classes during
  build time. For more details, see the [Tailwind CSS
  documentation](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/content-configuration#class-detection-in-depth).

3. **Better Integration**: The plugin ensures that Recast and Tailwind work
   together smoothly, allowing you to fully leverage both libraries'
   capabilities in your project.

This integration significantly enhances the developer experience when using
Recast with Tailwind CSS, offering increased flexibility and efficiency in
styling components.

## VS Code Setup

To get Tailwind CSS IntelliSense working with Recast in VS Code:

1. Install the
   [Tailwind CSS IntelliSense](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=bradlc.vscode-tailwindcss)
   VS Code extension.

2. Add the following to your `.vscode/settings.json`:

```json
{
  "tailwindCSS.experimental.classRegex": [
    [
      "recast\\(([^)]*)\\)",
      "(?<!(?:breakpoints|defaults|passThroughProps):\\s*(?:\\[|\\{)[^\\]}]*)[\"'`]([^\"'`]*).*?[\"'`]"
    ]
  ]
}
```

## Prettier Integration

Recast works seamlessly with the
[prettier-plugin-tailwindcss](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/prettier-plugin-tailwindcss).
Add the following to your `.prettierrc`:

```json
{ "tailwindFunctions": ["recast"] }
```

This ensures that your Tailwind classes within Recast components are properly
sorted.

    alt="Tailwind CSS VS Code Intellisense"
    width={891}
    height={546}
  />
</div>

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues with the Tailwind CSS integration:

1. Ensure you've installed both `@rpxl/recast` and
   `@rpxl/recast-tailwind-plugin`.
2. Verify that the Recast Tailwind plugin is correctly added to your
   `tailwind.config.js`.
3. Check that your VS Code settings are correctly configured for Tailwind CSS
   IntelliSense.
4. Clear your build cache and restart your development server.
