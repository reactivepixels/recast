## VS Code Setup

To get Tailwind CSS IntelliSense working with Recast in VS Code:

1. Install the
   [Tailwind CSS IntelliSense](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=bradlc.vscode-tailwindcss)
   VS Code extension.

2. Add the following to your `.vscode/settings.json`:

```json
{
  "tailwindCSS.experimental.classRegex": [
    ["recast\\(([^)]*)\\)", "[\"'`]([^\"'`]*).*?[\"'`]"]
  ]
}
```

## Prettier Integration

Recast works seamlessly with the
[prettier-plugin-tailwindcss](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/prettier-plugin-tailwindcss).
Add the following to your `.prettierrc`:

```json
{ "tailwindFunctions": ["recast"] }
```

This ensures that your Tailwind classes within Recast components are properly
sorted.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues with the Tailwind CSS integration:

1. Check that your VS Code settings are correctly configured for Tailwind CSS
   IntelliSense.
2. Clear your build cache and restart your development server.
