## Background

Creating component libraries is a challenging and time-consuming task. Even the
seemingly straightforward process of developing a sensible button component can
lead to a daunting proliferation of props, primarily driven by the need for
theming. Consider the numerous instances where theme-related props and styles
are embedded in a component - such as
`variant: "primary" | "secondary" | "tertiary"` or `size: "sm" | "md" | "lg"`.
This tight coupling of component props with theme requirements not only results
in an ever-expanding list of props but also presents a significant hurdle to
reusing components across projects without duplicating code purely for the
purposes of theming.

Imagine being able to liberate your component primitives from theme
dependencies, allowing them to be written once and used across projects.

## What is Recast?

Recast is not just a collection of small utilities; it is an approach/pattern to
building **truly** reusable component primitives by abstracting the theme layer
from the internal workings of a component.

The specific theme props and values that a component can receive are not
specified within the component, instead these are defined by wrapping the
component with a theme definition that will form the components theme API and
control the visual styling.

## How is this different to other component libraries?

There are an ever-growing number of component libraries out there attempting to
standardize theming by offering well-documented theme APIs, as exemplified by
systems like [MUI](https://mui.com/), [Chakra](https://chakra-ui.com/), and
[Ant Design](https://ant.design/). However, these frameworks necessitate the
adoption of predefined theme props and values, constraining users to a specific
set of theming conventions as theming props are still tightly coupled to the
components.

In contrast the Recast approach eliminates the need for adherence to predefined
theming props, values, or naming conventions. With Recast, you have the autonomy
to engineer your design system according to your unique requirements, allowing
you to tailor your design system to precisely fit your project's needs without
compromise.
