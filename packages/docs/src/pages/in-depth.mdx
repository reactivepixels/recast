# Anatomy of a Recast Component

The following guide is intended to give you a relatively detailed overview of
how Recast works and how to use it to build your own component library. It is
assumed that you have already installed the Recast library and have a basic
understanding of React and CSS.

## Primitives

The component primitive serves as the fundamental building block, focusing
solely on the semantics, accessibility, and internal functionality of the
component. It should not be concerned with the visual presentation.

Here is an illustration of a basic button component primitive developed without
Recast. To maintain brevity, it has been stripped back to exclude the typical
coupled theming props and CSS styles. Let's examine in detail how to convert
this to a Recast component primitive.

```tsx copy showLineNumbers filename="components/primitives/button.tsx"
import React, { ButtonHTMLAttributes, forwardRef } from "react";
type Props = ButtonHTMLAttributes<HTMLButtonElement>;

const ButtonPrimitive = forwardRef<HTMLButtonElement, Props>(
  ({ ...props }, ref) => {
    return <button ref={ref} {...props} />;
  },
);

ButtonPrimitive.displayName = "ButtonPrimitive";
```

<Steps>
### Import Utilities

Import the minimal set of utilities from Recast to create a component primitive.

```tsx copy showLineNumbers {2-7}  filename="components/primitives/button.tsx"
import React, { ButtonHTMLAttributes, forwardRef } from "react";
import {
  RecastBaseTheme,
  useRecastClasses,
  createRecastComponent,
  RecastThemeProps,
} from "@rpxl/recast";
/* ... */
```

### Define Theme Shape

The base theme is a type that defines the component's internal style "handles".
In other words, it establishes the points at which the component's internal
styles can be applied to a component via the theme layer.

```tsx copy showLineNumbers {9}  filename="components/primitives/button.tsx"
import React, { ButtonHTMLAttributes, forwardRef } from "react";
import {
  RecastBaseTheme,
  useRecastClasses,
  createRecastComponent,
  RecastThemeProps,
} from "@rpxl/recast";

type BaseTheme = RecastBaseTheme<"root">;
/* ... */
```

> Depending on the component, you may need to define additional handles for the
> component's internal styles. For example, a button component may have a
> `root{:tsx}` handle for the button element, and a `label{:tsx}` handle for the
> button's label. This could be defined as
> `RecastBaseTheme<"root" | "label">{:tsx}`

### Generate and Apply Classes

A Recast component primitive receives three additional props from the theme
layer: `themekey{:tsx}`, `variants{:tsx}`, `modifiers{:tsx}`. These props will
enable the component to derive the correct classes via the
`useRecastClasses{:tsx}` utility to then be applied to your component. The
component doesn't need to know anything about the theme layer other than how it
should be applied, as defined by the `BaseTheme{:tsx}`.

```tsx copy showLineNumbers /themekey/ /variants/ /modifiers/ /className={clsx(classes?.root, className)}/ {13-17,21}  filename="components/primitives/button.tsx"
import React, { ButtonHTMLAttributes, forwardRef } from "react";
import {
  RecastBaseTheme,
  useRecastClasses,
  createRecastComponent,
  RecastThemeProps,
} from "@rpxl/recast";

type BaseTheme = RecastBaseTheme<"root">;

const ButtonPrimitive = forwardRef<HTMLButtonElement, Props>(
  ({ themekey, variants, modifiers, className, ...props }, ref) => {
    const classes = useRecastClasses<BaseTheme>({
      themekey,
      variants,
      modifiers,
    });

    return (
      <button
        className={`${classes?.root} ${className}`}
        ref={ref}
        {...props}
      />
    );
  },
);
/* ... */
```

> Although not illustrated in the example above, we recommend using
> [clsx](https://github.com/lukeed/clsx). This is completely optional and not
> part of the Recast library. However, we recommend using it as it is a very
> lightweight utility (234b) that will ensure any classes passed as props get
> combined properly with the Recast generate classes. Alternatively, if you are
> using [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/), we recommend using the
> [tailwind-merge](https://github.com/dcastil/tailwind-merge) library to combine
> and properly resolve style conflicts.

### Export

Finally, we export the component primitive with the
`createRecastComponent{:tsx}` utility. This will wrap your primitive with a
compoent that is ready to accept and handle your external component theme layer.

```tsx copy showLineNumbers {31}  filename="components/primitives/button.tsx"
import React, { ButtonHTMLAttributes, forwardRef } from "react";
import {
  RecastBaseTheme,
  useRecastClasses,
  createRecastComponent,
  RecastThemeProps,
} from "@rpxl/recast";

type BaseTheme = RecastBaseTheme<"root">;

const ButtonPrimitive = forwardRef<HTMLButtonElement, Props>(
  ({ themekey, variants, modifiers, className, ...props }, ref) => {
    const classes = useRecastClasses<BaseTheme>({
      themekey,
      variants,
      modifiers,
    });

    return (
      <button
        className={`${classes?.root} ${className}`}
        ref={ref}
        {...props}
      />
    );
  },
);

ButtonPrimitive.displayName = "ButtonPrimitive";

export default createRecastComponent<Props, BaseTheme>(ButtonPrimitive);
```

</Steps>

## Theming

The theme layer is where the visual presentation of the component is defined. It
ensures that our styles are entirely decoupled from the component primitive,
maximizing reuse. The following guide will detail the creation of a theme layer
for a component primitive and elucidate the individual properties at our
disposal to fulfill any design requirements.

### Create a Themed Component

Once you have a component primitive, you can create a themed component by
importing the primitive and calling the `recast{:tsx}` method and passing an
empty object for ther arguments. This is all that is required to start using the
component in your project.

```tsx copy showLineNumbers filename="components/ui/button.ts"
import { ButtonPrimitive } from "@rpxl/recast-primitives";

export const Button = ButtonPrimitive.recast({});
```

Of course this is a very basic example and will only renders a button with no
styling. Let's build from this foundation and step through the process of
creating a beautifully themed button.

<Steps>
### Add Base Styles

The `base` property is where you define the base styles for your component. Base
styles will **always** be applied to your component. Depending on your component
primitives theme API you will have access to one or more handles to apply your
base styles to. For example, our button component primitive only has a `root`
handle, so therefore all our styles will be defined on the `root` key.

```tsx copy showLineNumbers {4-22} filename="components/ui/button.ts"
import { ButtonPrimitive } from "@components/primitives/button.tsx";

export const Button = ButtonPrimitive.recast({
  base: {
    root: [
      "inline-flex",
      "items-center",
      "justify-center",
      "whitespace-nowrap",
      "rounded-md",
      "text-sm",
      "font-medium",
      "ring-offset-background",
      "transition-colors",
      "focus-visible:outline-none",
      "focus-visible:ring-2",
      "focus-visible:ring-ring",
      "focus-visible:ring-offset-2",
      "disabled:pointer-events-none",
      "disabled:opacity-50",
    ],
  },
  /* ... */
});
```

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
  **Note** that the classes can be defined as a string or an array of strings.
  This is completely optional but intended to improve readability and
  maintainability of long class lists.
</Callout>

### Add Variants

The best way to describe variants is to think of them as distinct variations of
a component. Some common examples for a button component might be: "size" and
"intent". The "size" would define the size of the button e.g. small, medium,
large, and the "intent" would define the intention of the button e.g. success,
danger etc. With Recast it is possible to define any number of variants which
will start to form your button theme API.

```tsx copy showLineNumbers {7-24} filename="components/ui/button.ts"
"use client";

import { ButtonPrimitive } from "@components/primitives/button.tsx";

export const Button = ButtonPrimitive.recast({
  /* ... */
  variants: {
    size: {
      sm: { root: "h-9 rounded-md px-3" },
      md: { root: "h-10 px-4 py-2" },
      lg: { root: "h-11 rounded-md px-8" },
    },
    variant: {
      primary: {
        root: "bg-primary text-primary-foreground hover:bg-primary/90",
      },
      secondary: {
        root: "bg-secondary text-secondary-foreground hover:bg-secondary/80",
      },
      outline: {
        root: "border border-input bg-background hover:bg-accent hover:text-accent-foreground",
      },
    },
  },
  /* ... */
});
```

<Tabs items={["Code", "Preview"]}>
  <Tabs.Tab>
    ```tsx /variant="primary"/ /size="md"/ 
    import { Button } from "@/components/ui/button"
    
    export function ButtonDemo() {
      return (
        <Button variant="primary" size="md">Primary</Button>
      )
    }
    ```
  </Tabs.Tab>
  <Tabs.Tab>
    <ComponentPreview>
      <Button variant="primary" size="md">Primary</Button>
    </ComponentPreview>
  </Tabs.Tab>
</Tabs>

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
  It's important to note that any variants defined in your theme API will
  benefit from autocompletion and type checking, leveraging the power of
  TypeScript, assuming your editor supports these features.
</Callout>

### Add Modifiers

Modifiers are a powerful feature of Recast that essentially function as boolean
properties. Modifiers are variations of a component that can be "mixed-in" and
combined with other modifiers and all variants. Some common examples for a
button might include "floating" for an elevated button presentation and "block"
for a full-width button.

```tsx copy showLineNumbers {7-14} filename="components/ui/button.ts"
"use client";

import { ButtonPrimitive } from "@components/primitives/button.tsx";

export const Button = ButtonPrimitive.recast({
  /* ... */
  modifiers: {
    block: {
      root: "w-full",
    },
    floating: {
      root: "shadow-lg",
    },
  },
  /* ... */
});
```

<Tabs items={["Code", "Preview"]}>
  <Tabs.Tab>
    ```tsx  /floating/ /block/
    import { Button } from "@/components/ui/button"
    
    export function ButtonDemo() {
      return (
        <Button variant="primary" size="md" floating block>Primary</Button>
      )
    }
    ```
  </Tabs.Tab>
  <Tabs.Tab>
    <ComponentPreview>
      <Button variant="primary" size="md" floating block>Primary</Button>
    </ComponentPreview>
  </Tabs.Tab>
</Tabs>

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
  As a general rule of thumb, a theme variation should only be defined as a
  modifier if it can be combined with other variants and modifiers. For
  instance, representing button sizes as modifiers would not be advisable, as
  combining "sm," "md," and "lg" might not yield a deterministic result.
</Callout>

### Add Conditional Styles

Conditonals are a way to define conditional styles that will only be applied if
certain rules are met. For example, you may want to apply a certain style only
if the button `size === "lg"` and the `floating` modifier is enabled.

```tsx copy showLineNumbers {7-13} filename="components/ui/button.ts"
"use client";

import { ButtonPrimitive } from "@components/primitives/button.tsx";

export const Button = ButtonPrimitive.recast({
  /* ... */
  conditionals: [
    {
      variants: { size: "lg" },
      modifiers: ["floating"],
      classes: { root: "bg-green-500 text-white" },
    },
  ],
  /* ... */
});
```

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
  The `conditionals` property will take an array of conditions to validate
  independently. This means that you can define multiple conditions that will be
  applied in array order.
</Callout>

<Tabs items={["Code", "Preview"]}>
  <Tabs.Tab>
    ```tsx  /size="lg"/ /floating/
    import { Button } from "@/components/ui/button"
    
    export function ButtonDemo() {
      return (
        <Button variant="primary" size="lg" floating>Primary</Button>
      )
    }
    ```
  </Tabs.Tab>
  <Tabs.Tab>
    <ComponentPreview>
      <Button variant="primary" size="lg" floating>Primary</Button>
    </ComponentPreview>
  </Tabs.Tab>
</Tabs>

To take this one step further you can match combinations of variant values and
modifiers to meet a condition.

```tsx copy showLineNumbers {13,19} filename="components/ui/button.ts"
"use client";

import { ButtonPrimitive } from "@components/primitives/button.tsx";

export const Button = ButtonPrimitive.recast({
  /* ... */
  conditionals: [
    {
      /**
       * The following `variants` condition requires that the `size` is set to `lg`
       * and the `variant` is set to `primary` or `secondary`.
       */
      variants: { size: "lg", variant: ["primary", "secondary"] },

      /**
       * The following `modifiers` condition requires
       * that the `floating` and `block` modifiers are enabled.
       */
      modifiers: ["floating", "block"],
      classes: { root: "bg-green-500 text-white" },
    },
  ],
  /* ... */
});
```

### Set Some Defaults

Finally, we can set some default values for our component. This is useful to
reduce the amount of props that need to be passed to the component for common
component configuration. For example, we can set the `variant` to `primary` and
the `size` to `md` by default.

```tsx copy showLineNumbers {13,19} filename="components/ui/button.ts"
"use client";

import { ButtonPrimitive } from "@components/primitives/button.tsx";

export const Button = ButtonPrimitive.recast({
  /* ... */
  defaults: {
    variants: { variant: "primary", size: "md" },
  },
  /* ... */
});
```
