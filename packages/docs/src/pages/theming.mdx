# Theming with Recast

The theme layer is where the visual presentation of the component is defined. It
ensures that our styles are entirely decoupled from the component primitive,
maximizing reuse. This guide will detail the creation of a theme layer for a
component primitive and explain the individual properties available to fulfill
any design requirements.

> While the examples below use [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/), Recast
> works with any CSS solution, including CSS modules, CSS-in-JS libraries, or
> plain CSS classes.

## Creating a Themed Component

To create a themed component, import your component primitive and use the
`recast` function:

```jsx
import { recast } from "@rpxl/recast";
import ButtonPrimitive from "@/components/primitives/button";

export const Button = recast(ButtonPrimitive, {
  // Theme object
});
```

The `recast` function takes two arguments:

1. The component primitive
2. A theme object that defines the styling

Let's explore the structure of the theme object:

## Theme Object Structure

### Base Styles

Base styles are always applied to the component:

```jsx
export const Button = recast(ButtonPrimitive, {
  base: "inline-flex items-center justify-center rounded-md font-medium transition-colors",
  // ...
});
```

### Variants

Variants define different variations of your component:

```jsx
export const Button = recast(ButtonPrimitive, {
  // ...
  variants: {
    variant: {
      primary: "bg-blue-500 text-white hover:bg-blue-600",
      secondary: "bg-gray-200 text-gray-800 hover:bg-gray-300",
      outline: "border border-gray-300 text-gray-700 hover:bg-gray-100",
    },
    size: {
      sm: "px-3 py-2 text-sm",
      md: "px-4 py-2 text-base",
      lg: "px-6 py-3 text-lg",
    },
  },
  // ...
});
```

### Modifiers

Modifiers are boolean properties that can be combined with variants:

```jsx
export const Button = recast(ButtonPrimitive, {
  // ...
  modifiers: {
    fullWidth: "w-full",
    rounded: "rounded-full",
  },
  // ...
});
```

### Conditionals

Conditionals allow you to apply styles based on combinations of variants and
modifiers:

```jsx
export const Button = recast(ButtonPrimitive, {
  // ...
  conditionals: [
    {
      variants: { size: "lg", variant: "primary" },
      modifiers: ["fullWidth"],
      className: "font-bold uppercase",
    },
  ],
  // ...
});
```

### Defaults

Set default values for variants and modifiers:

```jsx
export const Button = recast(ButtonPrimitive, {
  // ...
  defaults: {
    variants: { variant: "primary", size: "md" },
    modifiers: ["rounded"],
  },
});
```

## Best Practices for Theming with Recast

1. Keep your component primitives simple and focused on functionality.
2. Use descriptive names for variants and modifiers.
3. Leverage conditionals for complex style combinations.
4. Set sensible defaults to reduce prop clutter in usage.
5. Use TypeScript for better type checking and developer experience.

By following these guidelines and utilizing the full power of Recast's theming
capabilities, you can create flexible, reusable components that can easily adapt
to different design requirements across projects.

<Steps>
### Add Base Styles

The `base` property is where you define the base styles for your component. Base
styles will **always** be applied to your component. Depending on your component
primitives theme API you will have access to one or more handles to apply your
base styles to (see [Advanced Usage](/advanced-usage)). For example, our button
component primitive only has one element, so therefore all our styles will be
defined directly to the `base` key.

```tsx copy showLineNumbers {5-21} filename="components/ui/button.ts"
import { recast } from "rpxl/recast";
import ButtonPrimitive from "@/components/primitives/button";

export const Button = recast(ButtonPrimitive, {
  base: [
    "inline-flex",
    "items-center",
    "justify-center",
    "whitespace-nowrap",
    "rounded-md",
    "text-sm",
    "font-medium",
    "ring-offset-background",
    "transition-colors",
    "focus-visible:outline-none",
    "focus-visible:ring-2",
    "focus-visible:ring-ring",
    "focus-visible:ring-offset-2",
    "disabled:pointer-events-none",
    "disabled:opacity-50",
  ],
  /* ... */
});
```

  **Note** that the classes can be defined as a string or an array of strings.
  This is completely optional but intended to improve readability and
  maintainability of long class lists.
</Callout>

### Add Variants

The best way to describe variants is to think of them as distinct variations of
a component. Some common examples for a button component might be: "size" and
"intent". The "size" would define the size of the button e.g. small, medium,
large, and the "intent" would define the intention of the button e.g. success,
danger etc. With Recast it is possible to define any number of variants which
will start to form your button theme API.

```tsx copy showLineNumbers {6-17} filename="components/ui/button.ts"
import { recast } from "rpxl/recast";
import ButtonPrimitive from "@/components/primitives/button";

export const Button = recast(ButtonPrimitive, {
  /* ... */
  variants: {
    size: {
      sm: "px-3 py-2 text-sm",
      md: "text-md px-5 py-2.5",
      lg: "px-8 py-3.5 text-lg",
    },
    primary:
      "bg-gradient-to-br from-purple-600 to-blue-500 text-white hover:bg-gradient-to-bl",
    secondary:
      "bg-gradient-to-r from-purple-500 to-pink-500 text-white hover:bg-gradient-to-l",
    outline: "border border-gray-300 bg-white text-gray-900 ",
  },
  /* ... */
});
```

<Tabs items={["Preview", "Code"]}>
  <Tabs.Tab>
    <ComponentPreview>
      <Button variant="primary" size="md">Primary</Button>
    </ComponentPreview>
  </Tabs.Tab>
  <Tabs.Tab>
    ```tsx /variant="primary"/ /size="md"/ 
    import { Button } from "@/components/ui/button"
    
    export function ButtonDemo() {
      return (
        <Button variant="primary" size="md">Primary</Button>
      )
    }
    ```
  </Tabs.Tab>
</Tabs>

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
  It's important to note that any variants defined in your theme API will
  benefit from autocompletion and type checking, leveraging the power of
  TypeScript, assuming your editor supports these features.
</Callout>

### Add Modifiers

Modifiers are a powerful feature of Recast that work like boolean properties.
Modifiers are variations of a component that can be "mixed-in" and combined with
other modifiers and all variants. Some common examples for a button might
include "floating" for an elevated button presentation and "block" for a
full-width button.

```tsx copy showLineNumbers {6-10} filename="components/ui/button.ts"
import { recast } from "rpxl/recast";
import ButtonPrimitive from "@/components/primitives/button";

export const Button = recast(ButtonPrimitive, {
  /* ... */
  modifiers: {
    block: "w-full",
    floating: "shadow-lg",
    pill: "rounded-full px-8",
  },
  /* ... */
});
```

<Tabs items={["Preview", "Code"]}>
  <Tabs.Tab>
    <ComponentPreview>
      <Button variant="outline" size="md" floating block>Primary</Button>
    </ComponentPreview>
  </Tabs.Tab>
  <Tabs.Tab>
    ```tsx  /floating/ /block/
    import { Button } from "@/components/ui/button"
    
    export function ButtonDemo() {
      return (
        <Button variant="outline" size="md" floating block>Primary</Button>
      )
    }
    ```
  </Tabs.Tab>
</Tabs>

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
  As a general rule of thumb, a component variation should only be defined as a
  modifier if it can be combined with other variants and modifiers. For
  instance, representing button sizes as modifiers would not be advisable, as
  combining "sm," "md," and "lg" will not yield a deterministic result.
</Callout>

### Add Conditional Styles

Conditonals are a way to define conditional styles that will only be applied if
certain rules are met. For example, you may want to apply a certain style only
if the button `size === "lg"` and the `floating` modifier is enabled.

```tsx copy showLineNumbers {6-12} filename="components/ui/button.ts"
import { recast } from "rpxl/recast";
import ButtonPrimitive from "@/components/primitives/button";

export const Button = recast(ButtonPrimitive, {
  /* ... */
  conditionals: [
    {
      variants: { size: "lg" },
      modifiers: ["floating"],
      className: "border-4 border-blue-500 text-white",
    },
  ],
  /* ... */
});
```

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
  The `conditionals` property will take an array of conditions to validate
  independently. This means that you can define multiple conditions that will be
  applied in array order.
</Callout>

<Tabs items={["Preview", "Code"]}>
  <Tabs.Tab>
    <ComponentPreview>
      <Button variant="secondary" size="lg" floating>Primary</Button>
    </ComponentPreview>
  </Tabs.Tab>
  <Tabs.Tab>
    ```tsx  /size="lg"/ /floating/
    import { Button } from "@/components/ui/button"
    
    export function ButtonDemo() {
      return (
        <Button variant="secondary" size="lg" floating>Primary</Button>
      )
    }
    ```
  </Tabs.Tab>

</Tabs>

To take this one step further you can match combinations of variant values and
modifiers to meet a condition.

```tsx copy showLineNumbers {12,18} filename="components/ui/button.ts"
import { recast } from "rpxl/recast";
import ButtonPrimitive from "@/components/primitives/button";

export const Button = recast(ButtonPrimitive, {
  /* ... */
  conditionals: [
    {
      /**
       * The following `variants` condition requires that the `size` is set to `lg`
       * and the `variant` is set to `primary` or `secondary`.
       */
      variants: { size: "lg", variant: ["primary", "secondary"] },

      /**
       * The following `modifiers` condition requires
       * that the `floating` and `block` modifiers are enabled.
       */
      modifiers: ["floating", "block"],
      className: "border-4 border-blue-500 text-white",
    },
  ],
  /* ... */
});
```

### Set Some Defaults

Finally, we can set some default values for our component. This is useful to
reduce the amount of props that need to be passed to the component for common
component configuration. For example, we can set the `variant` to `primary` and
the `size` to `md` by default.

```tsx copy showLineNumbers {6-8} filename="components/ui/button.ts"
import { recast } from "rpxl/recast";
import ButtonPrimitive from "@/components/primitives/button";

export const Button = recast(ButtonPrimitive, {
  /* ... */
  defaults: {
    variants: { variant: "primary", size: "md" },
  },
  /* ... */
});
```
