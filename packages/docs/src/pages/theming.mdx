# Theming with Recast

The theme layer is where the visual presentation of the component is defined. It
ensures that our styles are entirely decoupled from the component primitive,
maximizing reuse. The following guide will detail the creation of a theme layer
for a component primitive and elucidate the individual properties at our
disposal to fulfill any design requirements.

### Create a Themed Component

Once you have a component primitive, you can create a themed component by
importing the primitive and calling the `recast{:tsx}` method and passing any
React component. This is all that is required to start using a Recast component
in your project.

```tsx copy showLineNumbers filename="components/ui/button.ts"
import { recast } from "rpxl/recast";
import ButtonPrimitive from "@/components/primitives/button";

export const Button = recast(ButtonPrimitive, {});
```

Of course this is a very basic example and will only render a button with no
styling. Let's build from this foundation and step through the process of
creating a beautifully themed button.

<Steps>
### Add Base Styles

The `base` property is where you define the base styles for your component. Base
styles will **always** be applied to your component. Depending on your component
primitives theme API you will have access to one or more handles to apply your
base styles to (see [Advanced Usage](/advanced-usage)). For example, our button
component primitive only has one element, so therefore all our styles will be
defined directly to the `base` key.

```tsx copy showLineNumbers {5-21} filename="components/ui/button.ts"
import { recast } from "rpxl/recast";
import ButtonPrimitive from "@/components/primitives/button";

export const Button = recast(ButtonPrimitive, {
  base: [
    "inline-flex",
    "items-center",
    "justify-center",
    "whitespace-nowrap",
    "rounded-md",
    "text-sm",
    "font-medium",
    "ring-offset-background",
    "transition-colors",
    "focus-visible:outline-none",
    "focus-visible:ring-2",
    "focus-visible:ring-ring",
    "focus-visible:ring-offset-2",
    "disabled:pointer-events-none",
    "disabled:opacity-50",
  ],
  /* ... */
});
```

  **Note** that the classes can be defined as a string or an array of strings.
  This is completely optional but intended to improve readability and
  maintainability of long class lists.
</Callout>

### Add Variants

The best way to describe variants is to think of them as distinct variations of
a component. Some common examples for a button component might be: "size" and
"intent". The "size" would define the size of the button e.g. small, medium,
large, and the "intent" would define the intention of the button e.g. success,
danger etc. With Recast it is possible to define any number of variants which
will start to form your button theme API.

```tsx copy showLineNumbers {6-17} filename="components/ui/button.ts"
import { recast } from "rpxl/recast";
import ButtonPrimitive from "@/components/primitives/button";

export const Button = recast(ButtonPrimitive, {
  /* ... */
  variants: {
    size: {
      sm: "px-3 py-2 text-sm",
      md: "text-md px-5 py-2.5",
      lg: "px-8 py-3.5 text-lg",
    },
    primary:
      "bg-gradient-to-br from-purple-600 to-blue-500 text-white hover:bg-gradient-to-bl",
    secondary:
      "bg-gradient-to-r from-purple-500 to-pink-500 text-white hover:bg-gradient-to-l",
    outline: "border border-gray-300 bg-white text-gray-900 ",
  },
  /* ... */
});
```

<Tabs items={["Preview", "Code"]}>
  <Tabs.Tab>
    <ComponentPreview>
      <Button variant="primary" size="md">Primary</Button>
    </ComponentPreview>
  </Tabs.Tab>
  <Tabs.Tab>
    ```tsx /variant="primary"/ /size="md"/ 
    import { Button } from "@/components/ui/button"
    
    export function ButtonDemo() {
      return (
        <Button variant="primary" size="md">Primary</Button>
      )
    }
    ```
  </Tabs.Tab>
</Tabs>

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
  It's important to note that any variants defined in your theme API will
  benefit from autocompletion and type checking, leveraging the power of
  TypeScript, assuming your editor supports these features.
</Callout>

### Add Modifiers

Modifiers are a powerful feature of Recast that work like boolean properties.
Modifiers are variations of a component that can be "mixed-in" and combined with
other modifiers and all variants. Some common examples for a button might
include "floating" for an elevated button presentation and "block" for a
full-width button.

```tsx copy showLineNumbers {6-10} filename="components/ui/button.ts"
import { recast } from "rpxl/recast";
import ButtonPrimitive from "@/components/primitives/button";

export const Button = recast(ButtonPrimitive, {
  /* ... */
  modifiers: {
    block: "w-full",
    floating: "shadow-lg",
    pill: "rounded-full px-8",
  },
  /* ... */
});
```

<Tabs items={["Preview", "Code"]}>
  <Tabs.Tab>
    <ComponentPreview>
      <Button variant="outline" size="md" floating block>Primary</Button>
    </ComponentPreview>
  </Tabs.Tab>
  <Tabs.Tab>
    ```tsx  /floating/ /block/
    import { Button } from "@/components/ui/button"
    
    export function ButtonDemo() {
      return (
        <Button variant="outline" size="md" floating block>Primary</Button>
      )
    }
    ```
  </Tabs.Tab>
</Tabs>

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
  As a general rule of thumb, a component variation should only be defined as a
  modifier if it can be combined with other variants and modifiers. For
  instance, representing button sizes as modifiers would not be advisable, as
  combining "sm," "md," and "lg" will not yield a deterministic result.
</Callout>

### Add Conditional Styles

Conditonals are a way to define conditional styles that will only be applied if
certain rules are met. For example, you may want to apply a certain style only
if the button `size === "lg"` and the `floating` modifier is enabled.

```tsx copy showLineNumbers {6-12} filename="components/ui/button.ts"
import { recast } from "rpxl/recast";
import ButtonPrimitive from "@/components/primitives/button";

export const Button = recast(ButtonPrimitive, {
  /* ... */
  conditionals: [
    {
      variants: { size: "lg" },
      modifiers: ["floating"],
      className: "border-4 border-blue-500 text-white",
    },
  ],
  /* ... */
});
```

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
  The `conditionals` property will take an array of conditions to validate
  independently. This means that you can define multiple conditions that will be
  applied in array order.
</Callout>

<Tabs items={["Preview", "Code"]}>
  <Tabs.Tab>
    <ComponentPreview>
      <Button variant="secondary" size="lg" floating>Primary</Button>
    </ComponentPreview>
  </Tabs.Tab>
  <Tabs.Tab>
    ```tsx  /size="lg"/ /floating/
    import { Button } from "@/components/ui/button"
    
    export function ButtonDemo() {
      return (
        <Button variant="secondary" size="lg" floating>Primary</Button>
      )
    }
    ```
  </Tabs.Tab>

</Tabs>

To take this one step further you can match combinations of variant values and
modifiers to meet a condition.

```tsx copy showLineNumbers {12,18} filename="components/ui/button.ts"
import { recast } from "rpxl/recast";
import ButtonPrimitive from "@/components/primitives/button";

export const Button = recast(ButtonPrimitive, {
  /* ... */
  conditionals: [
    {
      /**
       * The following `variants` condition requires that the `size` is set to `lg`
       * and the `variant` is set to `primary` or `secondary`.
       */
      variants: { size: "lg", variant: ["primary", "secondary"] },

      /**
       * The following `modifiers` condition requires
       * that the `floating` and `block` modifiers are enabled.
       */
      modifiers: ["floating", "block"],
      className: "border-4 border-blue-500 text-white",
    },
  ],
  /* ... */
});
```

### Set Some Defaults

Finally, we can set some default values for our component. This is useful to
reduce the amount of props that need to be passed to the component for common
component configuration. For example, we can set the `variant` to `primary` and
the `size` to `md` by default.

```tsx copy showLineNumbers {6-8} filename="components/ui/button.ts"
import { recast } from "rpxl/recast";
import ButtonPrimitive from "@/components/primitives/button";

export const Button = recast(ButtonPrimitive, {
  /* ... */
  defaults: {
    variants: { variant: "primary", size: "md" },
  },
  /* ... */
});
```
