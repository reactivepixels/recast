# Advanced Usage

## Nested Component Structure

Recast is great for applying component styles to a single html element within
your components and offers a very comparable experience to other utilities lic
[cva](https://cva.style/docs), [tv](https://www.tailwind-variants.org/) and
[stitches](https://stitches.dev/docs/variants). However, when it comes to
managing more complex React component structures, Recast really shines.

Take for example this slider component taken from
[shad/cn](https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/components/slider) and based on the
[Radix UI](https://www.radix-ui.com/primitives/docs/components/slider) library.
You will see that the slider component is composed of multiple elements which
could each have styles applied independently. Recast provides a mechanism to
achieve this with minimal footprint on your component primitives.

```tsx copy showLineNumbers {3,8-13,23,25,29} /rcx/ filename="components/primitives/slider.tsx"
import { cn } from "../../utils/cn.js";
import * as RadixSliderPrimitive from "@radix-ui/react-slider";
import { RecastWithClassNameProps } from "@rpxl/recast"; /** Import the Recast type utility */
import React, { forwardRef } from "react";

type Props = React.ComponentPropsWithoutRef<typeof RadixSliderPrimitive.Root> &
  /** Define your component className props here*/
  RecastWithClassNameProps<{
    root: string;
    track: string;
    range: string;
    thumb: string;
  }>;

const Slider = forwardRef<
  React.ElementRef<typeof RadixSliderPrimitive.Root>,
  Props
  /**
   * Your component can now receive styles on any
   * Recast className "anchor" via the `rcx` component prop. */
>(({ className, rcx, ...props }, ref) => {
  return (
    <RadixSliderPrimitive.Root
      ref={ref}
      className={cn(rcx?.root, className)}
      {...props}
    >
      <RadixSliderPrimitive.Track className={rcx?.track}>
        <RadixSliderPrimitive.Range className={rcx?.range} />
      </RadixSliderPrimitive.Track>
      <RadixSliderPrimitive.Thumb className={rcx?.thumb} />
    </RadixSliderPrimitive.Root>
  );
});

/* ... */
```

Now when you wrap your component with Recast, you can apply styles to the nested
elements. All Recast theme props are available to the nested elements as well.

```tsx copy showLineNumbers filename="components/ui/slider.tsx"
export const Slider = recast(SliderPrimitive, {
  base: {
    root: "relative flex w-full touch-none select-none items-center",
    track: "relative h-1.5 w-full grow overflow-hidden rounded-full bg-black",
    range: "bg-primary absolute h-full",
    thumb: "block h-4 w-4 rounded-full border border-black/50 bg-white shadow",
  },
  /* ... Other recast theme props */
});
```

> Note: Even though this component uses nested className props it will still
> work used outside of Recast as a standalone component.

## Wrap a Recast Component

It is foreseeable that you may want to "wrap" a Recast component for certain
cases. For instance, in the example below, we are wrapping the
ScrollAreaPrimitive component to eliminate the variant prop from the consumer.
Instead, we conditionally apply the variant styles based on the component's
built-in orientation prop (horizontal | vertical). In this scenario, we aim to
spare the consumer from having to add both the orientation and the variant prop,
as the latter can be inferred simply by the orientation prop.

```tsx copy showLineNumbers filename="components/ui/scroll-area.tsx"
"use client";
import { recast } from "@rpxl/recast";
import { ScrollAreaPrimitive } from "@/components/primitives/scroll-area.tsx";
import { forwardRef } from "react";

const BaseScrollArea = recast(ScrollAreaPrimitive, {
  // This matches the default for the primitives built in `orientation` prop
  defaults: { variants: { variant: "vertical" } },
  base: {
    root: "relative overflow-hidden",
    viewport: "h-full w-full rounded-[inherit]",
    thumb: "bg-border relative flex-1 rounded-full",
    scrollbar: "flex touch-none select-none transition-colors",
  },
  variants: {
    variant: {
      vertical: {
        scrollbar: "h-full w-2.5 border-l border-l-transparent p-[1px]",
      },
      horizontal: {
        scrollbar: "h-2.5 flex-col border-t border-t-transparent p-[1px]",
      },
    },
  },
});

// Remove the variant prop from the consumer as it will be conditionally
// applied based on the components built in `orientation` prop
type Props = Omit<
  React.ComponentPropsWithoutRef<typeof BaseScrollArea>,
  "variant"
>;

export const ScrollArea = forwardRef<
  React.ElementRef<typeof BaseScrollArea>,
  Props
>(({ ...props }, ref) => {
  // Here we use the components built in `orientation`
  // prop to configure the variant styles
  return <BaseScrollArea ref={ref} variant={props.orientation} {...props} />;
});

ScrollArea.displayName = "ScrollArea";
```
