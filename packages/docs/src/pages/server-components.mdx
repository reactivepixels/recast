# Server components

Recast fully supports
[React Server Components](https://vercel.com/blog/understanding-react-server-components).
In theory this means that you can use Recast to build components and reduce the
need to ship related JavaScript to the browser. In practice however, it is
common for a rich component library to utilise client side features. Whether you
opt-in to using Server Compoents will be dependent on your specific component
requirements
